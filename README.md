# go-notes
Collection of notes on main Go topics #go #golang #study

# Rationale

I ~know #Go since about 2016 - a couple of patches to Go software already accepted - but I still lack of many info, so I started collecting all the main topics and links to clarify all.
I said this will be a public resource and there it is

Any hint is more than welcome ðŸ’ª


# TODO

- [x] collect a list of GO main topics
- [x] collect links regarding GO main topics
- [x] map links and topics
- [ ] read, digest and elaborate each topic
- [ ] write example code
- [ ] buy milk!
